<h4>Research</h4>
        <p> My research phase went quite in depth into the world of student portfolios. Initially, I wanted to take a whole other direction 
            by using white, black and red as the accent colour. After further research and discussions with instructors and peers,
            I decided to take the design from my student landing page and expand on some of the elements of that design.
        </p>

    <h4>Planning</h4>
        <p>I first wrote a content plan and created wireframes for the mobile version of the site. After finalizing the Initial
            wireframes, I create a couple of wireframes for the desktop version of the site as well.

  <p>As mentioned in the above summary, my designs choices are based on the paintings by Piet Mondrian. 
      He used obvious grids and three bold primary colours, which I toned down the boldness of for this project.

    <h4>Development</h4>
    <p>Once the designs were complete, I began entering all the HTML code, using HTML5 semantics. As I was entering the HTML content, I realized that
        this would be a good opportunity to use Trello and keep track of this project.
