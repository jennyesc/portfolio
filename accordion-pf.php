            <p> Once the designs were complete, I started by creating the content, such as the images used throughout the project. 
                After the content creation, I started entering all of the HTML code, using HTML5 semantics. Once all of the content was placed, I 
                started styling the website, using CSS/Sass, JavaScript and JQuery.
            </p>
            <h4>Responsive Images </h4>
            <p>Where required (ie. hero images), I used the srcset and picture elements to ensure appropriate image sizes were used for difference screen size and devices.</p>

            <h4>PHP Templates</h4>
            <p> I used PHP templates for the reusable code througout the site to make my code and development DRY. The head, header, footer and accordions were all used as php includes on throughout the site. </p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>&ensp;Workflow & Launch</h3>
            
            <p>Even though I worked solo on this project, I used Sass to keep the code tidy and consistent using variables, mixins and partials. As the @import rule is being phased out, 
                I used the @use rule, as recommended by the Sass team. 
            </p>
            <p class="last-par"> When styling had been completed, I validated the code on my local server. After the code validation, I moved it on to my live server within a 
            sub-folder to test on various devices and debug the site.
            Once the site's kinks had been worked out, I installed Google Analytics and recommended SEO requirememts before moving the site to the root folder for launch.

            <h3><i class="far fa-comment-dots"></i>&ensp;Reflections</h3>
            <p>The version of this portfolio project you are viewing is probably not the version I had up when I wrote this. 
                As everyone kept telling me, the portfolio site is always evolving.</p>

            <p>This project has definitely been a learning opportunity for me. It gave me the opportunity to try out new skills and learn as I go. As we did our program during global pandemic, 
                we worked on the portfolio project individually and I missed the collaboration that happens during team project or even in a class room setting. Thankfully, I developed positive 
                relationships with my classmates and they were there to lend a hand when needed (and vice versa). I definitely learnt to let go of my 
                print industry graphic design background and needing things to be pixel perfect.</p>

            <p>When I had submitted my portfolio, it was not at the level that I needed it to be to feel proud of it. 
                As we were working on our Capstone project simultaneously, I didn't look at my portfolio after it was submitted. Once our program completed, 
                I worked on small updates before tackling the bigger changes that needed to be made. </p>

            <p>As I am working on this version of the portfolio, I am starting to feel that pride again. During the content development phase, 
                I spent a good chunk of time gathering appropriate template files to create images with the most impact. I am very proud of the images and content on the site.
