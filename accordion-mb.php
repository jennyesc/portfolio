<h4>Research</h4>
        <p>We were provided with various examples for this project, which gave me some direction for the look and feel. <br>
        For the layout, I choose to base my design knowing that I would be using CSS3 grid. I was really drawn to the dark colour
        schemes in other examples.
    </p> 

    <h4>Planning</h4>
        <p> We decided to use the mockup designs and create a static site, using the React components and routers. As the content 
            is all dynamic, we wanted to ensure the designs translated into the code before we set up the dynamic elements of the site.

  <p> The design is based on a dark movie theatre, but with the pop of neon pink for a nice contrasting colour. When I created the logo, I 
      really wanted to emulate the neon lights to give the design a little bit of a retro touch. </p>

    <h4>Development</h4>
    <p>We set up our Sass partials, variables and mixins and then developed a static version of our React app. 
        Once we completed the static site, we started coding the functionality components. We used the rest API from 
        TMDB and would refer to the developer support community when we needed support. We also created JavaScript functions to format
        some of the data, which was pulled in. One of these functions was our date maker, which would format the release date to display
        according to our designs.</p>

    <p> GitHub was used for version control during development.
    </p>

    <h4>Launch</h4>
    <p>Once we completed our React app, we ran the build command and created the files to be loaded on our live server.</p>
