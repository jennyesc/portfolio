            <h3><i class="fas fa-search"></i>&ensp;Research</h3>
            <p>We were provided with various examples for this project, which gave me some direction for the look and feel. <br>
                For the layout, I choose to base my design knowing that I would be using CSS3 grid. I was really drawn to the dark colour
                schemes in other examples.</p> 
    
            <h3> <i class="far fa-sticky-note"></i>&ensp;Planning</h3>
            <p> We decided to use the mockup designs and create a static site, using the React components and routers. As the content 
            is all dynamic, we wanted to ensure the designs translated into the code before we set up the dynamic elements of the site.

            <p> The design is based on a dark movie theatre, but with the pop of neon pink for a nice contrasting colour. When I created the logo, I 
            really wanted to emulate the neon lights to give the design a little bit of a retro touch. </p>

            <p class="last-par"> We set up our Sass partials, variables and mixins. We then developed a static version of our React app. 
            After completing the static version, we used the rest API from TMDB to call in the content.
            When we were facing a challenge, we would refer to the developer support community when we needed support. JavaScript functions were created to format
            some of the data. One of these functions was our date maker, which would format the release date to display
            according to our designs.</p>
         
            <h3><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>&ensp;Workflow & Launch</h3>
            <p class="last-par"> We used GitHub for version control, which was an intrical component of our workflow, as we were also working with Sass.
                Once the project was completed in the development phase, we ran the build command, which created our final version to be uploaded to our live server</p>

            <p>This was a great project to jump in feet first using React. We did get a bit of assistance from our instructor, which helped us 
                a great deal during development. I plan to create another React app to grasp a better understanding of the funcitonality development. 
                My focus was more on the styling and troubleshooting during the development process and my partner took on more of the functionality.</p> 

                <p class="last-par">Overall, I am proud of the end result and that we were able to create a site, which had all the functionality required, resembled the original 
                mockup designs and is fully responsive. </p>
