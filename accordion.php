            <p>After receiving the brief, my teammates and I began by researching other bakeries and cafes with a similar homey, friendly, welcoming vision. Once we collectively decided on our top five websites, 
                we prepared our website needs analysis with questions to ask our client during the discovery meeting.

                <p>Even though mockups were not a requirement for our project, we created high fidelity mockups.
                    Creating these mockups really helped our team establish the overall look and feel for the site, which in 
                    turn made the development phase a lot smoother.  </p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>&ensp;Development</h3>
            <p>We started the project by entering all the content first, 
                followed by coding the functionality using PHP. 
                Once we started styling, we styled for mobile first with media queries to accomodate responsive designs for tablet and desktop sizes.</p>
            
            <h4>Advanced Custom Fields WordPress plugin</h4>
            <p class="last-par"> ACF gives us developers complete control of the content and
                limit what the client can edit upon completion. </p>

            <h4>Other WordPress plugins</h4>

            <p>In addition to WooCommerce and ACF, we utilized plugins such as 
                Spotlight - Social Media Feeds, Forminator, WP Slick Slider, JetPack, Yoast SEO, Wordfence, and UpdraftPlus.</p> 

            <p class="last-par"> During the development phase, we also used Reveal IDs, Show Current Template and WP Migrate DB Pro.
             </p>

            <h3><i class="fas fa-rocket"></i>&ensp;Workflow & Launch</h3>
            <p> We used GitHub for version control, which was an intrical component of our workflow, as we were also working with Sass.
                The content was uploaded to our live site and then migrated to our local servers using WP Migrate.
                Any changes to our code or styles were uploaded via FileZilla.   
            </p>

            <p class="last-par"> When the content and styling was finalized, we customized the login page and dashboard and installed 
                the Wordfence Security plugin. 
            </p>

            <h3><i class="far fa-comment-dots"></i>&ensp;Reflections</h3>
            <p>My biggest take away from this project is the importance of communications on a team. I feel so fortunate to have been part of our team, as we were always in communication with each other. When we formed the group, we all came into it with different strengths and comfort levels. These skills were maximized during the project and taught to the others. 
            When one member would not understand part of the process, there was always someone there to lend a hand.</p> 

            <p> We created a Trello board to keep track of our project and the key content documents. 
                As we all worked together cropping 83 product photos,
                we used a shared Dropbox folder to avoid any duplicate efforts made during the process.

            <p>I learned a lot during this project, especially when it came to styling WordPress sites. 
                I am proud to say that we had zero merge conflicts during the project and am very proud of our end result.</p> 

            <p> In conclusion, I invite you to take a look at the <a href="http://www.jennyescobell.com/twosisters/notapage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">404 page</a> created by me. 
            I always appreciate a clever 404 page, which still serves its purpose to keep the user on the site.
